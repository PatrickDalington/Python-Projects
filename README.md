| Project 1 | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
|**Simple single line calculator**| Running something like **2+2**,... upon enter, you get the addition of both numbers.\n Unlike the bare basic where you have to get input after new line. **For example: 2+2** ( 2 will be taken after a new line, then the plus(+) sign and then the last 2). In total we will be having **3 new lines**. This can be boring sometimes for the user to enter the aurguments individually. So I created this to make it easier... All a user need to do is input figures and operator and the code will do the rest. I have explained everything I did in the code using comments. **Enjoy ):**|
